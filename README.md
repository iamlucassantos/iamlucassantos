👋🏽 I'm *Lucas Vieira dos Santos*, a Brazilian who is fascinated by any machine that flies
🚀 I'm currently studying Aerospace engineering in the Netherlands 
However, in my free time, when I’m not watching or studying all things space, I’m very likely to be programming

Python is my go-to language, where i have to work on many types of projects, such as engineering design, game development, and the creation of web applications. At the moment, I’m focusing on data science and how to use Python for Machine Learning.
